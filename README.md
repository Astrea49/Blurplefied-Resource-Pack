Minecraft, but in Discord's Blurple!

Do you like the color blurple that Discord uses? Did you ever wanted to experience Minecraft in that color even if it makes everything look samey? Well, I got the perfect resource pack for you!

Idea by CaptainGame17. Made partially because Discord's 5th anniversary was coming up when I made this, and for the people in the Project Blurple server (which this got featured in).

Most of the blocks, entities, armor, art, and other visual effects have been blurplefied. However, some things, such as some particles (looking at you redstone), banners, shield patterns, leather armor, and more are still in their original color. This is because vanilla Minecraft only allows for so much; I cannot do much beyond what I have done.

The modded enhancements add-on is a resource pack made for people who are willing to use mods - either Optifine (for Forge) or Colormatic (for Fabric) as of right now. These add-ons make water look *much* better and fix various other issues with coloring that I cannot fix with vanilla Minecraft. If you wish, download this and put it **above** the normal pack.

Enjoy a blurple wonderland!
